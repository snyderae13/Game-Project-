# Game-Project-

My inspiration for the game came from looking around at various mini games and one caught my eye called : Mini Guardians Castle Defense. After playing it a few times I thought about how I could simplify the game and make the enemies just come from one side of the screen. W3school's Game Tutorial Documentation, and MDN's web docs  helped me tremendously throughout the project, especially when it came to detecting collision and setting up the audio. The controls are really simple : click anywhere on the canvas (game Screen) and you will deploy a defender (wizard). Each defender Cost's 100 of your Resources. Once you kill an enemy (dragon) you receive 20 points to your score and 20 to your resources. You start out with 300 Resource points so you have 3 wizards in the beginning. Once the Score reaches 300, you win the game. If a dragon makes it to the end of the left side of the screen, you lose. The Defender's Health is represented by the gold 100 above them and the dragon's health is the black 100 above them. If your defender collides with the dragon it will take the health of the dragon and subtract from your wizard. If your wizard's health reaches 100, they are eliminated from the game. WARNING - Once you click on the screen the game music will play so please check your volume levels on your computer so you won't be startled by the music

Future Plans for the Game:
I want to be able to add my second defender character ( a princess) as well as another enemy to make the game have more variety. Also adding extra levels would make it more enjoyable to play rather than just one level. Also thinking about making it more responsive for screen sizes is the next thing I would like to tackle , so that way you don't have to play it only in fullscreen.Another option could be to create another function for when there isn't an enemy on the screen, and it makes the defender stop shooting their projectile
